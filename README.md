# Cycler - steelhacks2019

This project won 1st place at Steelhacks 2019 and best use of Google Cloud.

## About
We have interned at places that have strict rules on what things can and cannot be recycled. This way companies can significantly reduce the carbon footprint left behind from sending recyclable items to a landfill. This is a cross-platform mobile application that uses image classification provided by Google Cloud Vision, to determine what exactly an object is, and then further classify if it is recyclable or compostable.
